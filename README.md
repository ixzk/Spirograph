## Introduce

The Spirograph is a drawing toy, composed of two parts: an external drawing board and an internal circular drawing board. The inner circle board is like a gear, with many pen holes at different radius along the center of the circle. The outer board is a large circular hole similar to the inner gear. The inner circular board is placed in the circular hole of the outer drawing board and rotates along the circumference. A regular pattern like a flower can be drawn from the pen hole with a pencil.

## 介绍

繁花曲线规(万花尺)是我小时候玩过的玩具，它由两部分组成，一个较大的外圆齿轮，和各种不同尺寸的内齿轮。 内齿轮上有许多孔，可随机选择一个孔，将画笔插入孔中，并且绕外圆齿轮进行运动，最后，我们便可以得到一张有规律的图片。
